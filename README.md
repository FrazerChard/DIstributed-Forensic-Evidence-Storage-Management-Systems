# DIstributed-Forensic-Evidence-Storage-Management-Systems

This work explores the major distributed technologies that could help to secure digital forensics evidence systems due to issues seen with current storage methods for this type of data. 
It explores various distributed ledger technologies, including the blockchain, the Arweave blockweave and the Hedera hashgraph, as well as distributed storage methods and secure proofs. 
There are some identified weaknesses with that using a more open, honest and reliable distributed system would improve.
It was ultimately found that a customised system would need to be designed with all 43 police forces in a consortium, hosting distributed storage and ledger nodes between all departments within all forces.
